            <p class="intro">
                These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of CarSaavy's website and services. By purchasing a report, requesting a free report, or using our services, you agree to these Terms. Please read them carefully.
            </p>

            <h2>1. Services Provided</h2>
            <p>
                CarSaavy provides vehicle negotiation intelligence reports designed to assist buyers in understanding market positioning, inspection priorities, and negotiation strategy. We currently offer three primary tiers:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Negotiation Positioning (Free):</strong> An automated framework with general strategy, negotiation guidance, and dealer response scripts, delivered instantly after you submit your information.</li>
                <li><strong>Essentials:</strong> A manual vehicle-specific analysis with inspection priorities and risk assessment, offered with different delivery timeframes (for example, standard and rush delivery).</li>
                <li><strong>Comprehensive:</strong> A full tactical breakdown with specific pricing targets, dealer counterplay, and a complete negotiation sequence, also offered with different delivery timeframes.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                We may add, change, or discontinue report tiers, features, or pricing at any time. Any changes will apply to future orders only and will not retroactively alter previously completed purchases.
            </p>

            <h2>2. Purchases & Payment</h2>
            
            <h3>Pricing</h3>
            <p>
                All paid report prices are listed in U.S. dollars and are subject to change. Promotional or "launch pricing" may be offered for a limited time or a limited number of customers. Free offerings, including the Negotiation Positioning report, may be modified, limited, or discontinued at any time at our discretion.
            </p>

            <h3>Payment Processing</h3>
            <p>
                Payments for paid reports are processed securely through Stripe. By submitting payment information, you authorize CarSaavy to charge the total amount for your selected report tier.
            </p>

            <h3>Order Confirmation</h3>
            <p>
                For paid reports, you will receive an email confirmation once your order is placed. For manual reports, this email will include your order reference number and expected delivery timeframe. For free Negotiation Positioning reports, you may receive a confirmation email and/or a direct delivery email with your report.
            </p>

            <h2>3. Delivery</h2>
            
            <h3>Automated Reports (Negotiation Positioning)</h3>
            <p>
                Negotiation Positioning reports are delivered instantly via email after you submit the required information. Negotiation Positioning is currently offered free of charge; however, we reserve the right to adjust availability or pricing in the future.
            </p>

            <h3>Manual Reports</h3>
            <p>
                Essentials and Comprehensive reports are delivered within the timeframe selected at purchase (for example, 48 hours or 24 hours from order confirmation). Delivery times are measured in Eastern Time (EST/EDT, as applicable).
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Standard delivery:</strong> Report delivered within the stated standard timeframe (for example, 48 hours) of order confirmation</li>
                <li><strong>Rush delivery:</strong> Report delivered within the stated rush timeframe (for example, 24 hours) of order confirmation</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="info-box">
                <p><strong>Missed Deadlines:</strong> If we fail to deliver your paid manual report within the promised timeframe, you will receive either a full refund or a credit toward a future report at your choice.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Delivery Format</h3>
            <p>
                Reports are delivered via email as a downloadable PDF and may also include an interactive HTML link or similar format. Both formats, where provided, contain the same core content and analysis.
            </p>

            <h2>4. Refund Policy</h2>
            
            <h3>Automated Reports (Negotiation Positioning)</h3>
            <p>
                Negotiation Positioning reports are currently offered free of charge. Because no payment is collected for this report, refunds, credits, or other monetary compensation are not applicable to Negotiation Positioning.
            </p>

            <h3>Manual Reports (Essentials and Comprehensive)</h3>
            <p>
                Essentials and Comprehensive reports are <strong>final sale once research begins</strong>. Refunds for paid manual reports are only issued if:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>CarSaavy cannot fulfill the report due to service issues or technical problems; or</li>
                <li>The intake data provided is unserviceable (e.g., invalid VIN, inaccessible listing) and the issue cannot be resolved with your cooperation; or</li>
                <li>We fail to deliver within the promised timeframe for a paid report (you may choose refund or credit as described above).</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <p><strong>Important:</strong> If the vehicle you requested a report for sells or becomes unavailable before delivery, this does not qualify for a refund. The analysis, strategies, and frameworks in your report can still be applied to comparable vehicles and future negotiations.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Requesting a Refund</h3>
            <p>
                To request a refund for an eligible paid report, contact <strong>support@carsaavy.com</strong> with your order reference number and a brief explanation of the issue. We may ask for additional information to investigate your request.
            </p>
